# Tumor Segmentation

Tumor Segmentation is a project aimed at automating the process of identifying and segmenting tumors in medical images using advanced machine learning and image processing techniques.

## Features

- **Automated Tumor Detection**: Leverages deep learning models to detect tumors in medical scans.
- **Image Segmentation**: Provides precise segmentation of tumor regions.
- **Customizable Models**: Supports fine-tuning for specific datasets.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes tools for visualizing segmentation results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TumorSegmentation.git
    cd TumorSegmentation
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary medical image datasets.

## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py --input /path/to/dataset --output /path/to/output
    ```

2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config config.yaml
    ```

3. Perform segmentation on new images:
    ```bash
    python segment.py --input /path/to/image --output /path/to/result
    ```

4. Visualize results:
    ```bash
    python visualize.py --input /path/to/result
    ```
